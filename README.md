This research aims to identify the mistakes made by Hong Kong tertairy students in speaking english. There are differences in Cantonese and Englsih in terms of Phonetics and Phonology. It contributes to the errors made by Hong Kong students in speaking a second language like English. We will collect an hour long audio data to analyse the mistakes made by the students we have interviews.
