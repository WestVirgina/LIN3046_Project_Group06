Topic: Examining the common error in oral english of Hong Kong students: exploring the pronunciation differences of /t/, /d/, and /id/.



## Introduction





This research aims to identify the mistakes made by Hong Kong tertairy students in speaking english. There are differences in Cantonese and Englsih in terms of Phonetics and Phonology. It contributes to the errors made by Hong Kong students in speaking a second language like English. We will collect an hour long audio data to analyse the mistakes made by the students we have interviews. 

We identify a trend where Hong Kong people do not know how to distinguish the three different types of –ed ending sounds. 
In this project we asked students in different universities (excluding English major students) to read a list of words to see if they could differentiate the –ed ending sounds.

Then, we analysed the data we collected from a collective hour-long recording.

After we collected all the sample speech data we needed, we started to do the data cleaning.
Then we will do the data analysis.








## Data

The interviewees were asked to read out the list of words we have provided. A total of 72 words and there is an equal number of different types of –ed ending sound.

We collected and put our data into the shared Google Drive folder. We named each file systematically. 

For example: 1. Name_School_Programme_Year

All the audio data are saved in a shared google drive file in Google Drive. The attached is the file of the recordings. 22 recordings are collected which the duration is about an hour long.

## Methodology

a) We collected an hour worth of data. We gave all the participants in our project a list of 75 common English words. All the participants are 18 or above and are/were not pursuing an English degree. A total of 7 to 8 participants were found by each group member, and each recording lasted for around 3 minutes.



b) In order to ensure the audio was clear and not corrupt, we did the cleaning process beforehand. What we mean by that is, we gave specific guidelines to the participants on how they can ensure that the recordings are perfect. This is what we told them;
1. Make sure there is no background noise when recording,

2. Make sure to have 2 to 3 seconds pause between each word,

3. Do not try to correct a word if mispronounced,

4. Do not read the words too slow or too fast – Aim for the 3-minute mark,

5. Pronounce the words to the best of your abilities.



c) After receiving the audio files, we put them into Google Drive. When it comes to analysis, we played each audio file one-by-one, and listened to how the participants pronounced the words. For the tags in the Google Sheet, we used the IPA to record the ending of the words. For example, if the word “helped” is pronounced correctly, we will write ![Capture](https://github.com/WestVirgina/LIN3046_Project_Group06/assets/157775248/9291c9a0-47cf-42f7-8902-e9030a980b3e)
. We just used the 3 IPA on the word list to differentiate the ending sound of the words pronounced by the students. If the words are pronounced completely wrong, then we use this tagset ![Capture1](https://github.com/WestVirgina/LIN3046_Project_Group06/assets/157775248/84527e23-bd38-4058-9337-14d2f09b1b0e)
. Finally, if we did not hear the word at all, then we would use this tagset ![Capture2](https://github.com/WestVirgina/LIN3046_Project_Group06/assets/157775248/5afe1078-4a3b-4168-b85c-c6de60e361c2).


d) Ethics

All participants were 18 OR ABOVE

All participants gave CONSENT

All participants KNEW data will be further used

All participants VOLUNTEERED to help out

None of the participants were ENGLISH MAJOR students



Hour long audio data will be collected through direct messaging. Participants will be given a list of words that contained the ending syllable sounds of [t], [id] and [d].

## Discussions

It is discovered that there are quite a number of mistakes noted in the recordings when we count the number of the wrong tagset “–” . 

It is theorized that the interviewees are using the Cantonese variation to speak the vocab list instead of standard English. Apart from that, the majority of the interviewees used their mother tongue accent when speaking the word (I.E. Cantonese, Chinese, Hindi, etc) causing Mispronunciations. 

In Cantonese variation, people tend to put the stress on the last stress and put the word ‘突‘ for the –ed ending sound instead of figuring out which –ed ending sound that is.

In Hindi variation, due to the thick accent, all the words end the same way even though there is a clear difference.

Adhering to the internal deadlines set by him was extremely crucial in order to complete the task on or before the final deadline (Once again, thanks for granting the extension to all of us, Dr Chaak and Dr Cheung). Apart from that, he contributed fully in doing the Google Sheets, and helped with the Github, particularly with the methodology and contributors parts.


Kwok King Hin

Edison was in charge of making and editing the Github. Since this lands in his domain, he easily made the README.md. On top of that, he worked on all the points. Moreover, he has contributed towards the Google Sheet by suggesting appropriate columns, and he added different functions to expedite our work. He is also responsible for coming up with this topic idea.


Lam Ho Fung Jamie

Jamie was in charge of transcribing the audio files. Jamie’s expertise is in the movie industry, and with some prior dialogue transcription experience, he took upon this task himself, and done it perfectly. He, not only transcribed the audio files of his own participants, but also took the liberty of transcribing everything. Additionally, he also contributed on the Github. During our phone calls and Google Meets’ sessions, he made valuable contributions and useful suggestions.
