Introduction


Topic: Examining the common error in oral english of Hong Kong students: exploring the differences of /t/, /d/, and /id/


This research aims to identify the mistakes made by Hong Kong tertairy students in speaking english. There are differences in Cantonese and Englsih in terms of Phonetics and Phonology. It contributes to the errors made by Hong Kong students in speaking a second language like English. We will collect an hour long audio data to analyse the mistakes made by the students we have interviews. 









Data

All the audio data are saved in a shared google drive file in Google Drive. The attached is the file of the recordings. 22 recordings are collected which the duration is about an hour long.
